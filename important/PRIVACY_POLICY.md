# PRIVACY POLICY

**Effective Date: December 13, 2025**
**Last Updated: December 13, 2025**

## 12. BETA PROGRAM & EXTERNAL PAYMENT HANDLING

If you enroll in Lift's beta program, certain features or payments may be
processed outside of the platform (for example via Cash App) as part of limited
promotions or pilot programs. When beta payments are routed through third-party
payment providers, those providers' privacy and payment processing policies
apply to the payment transaction. We may collect and retain additional
diagnostic or usage data from beta program participants to improve the service
and investigate issues. Such data collection will be limited to what is
necessary for product improvement and security. If you do not consent to data
collection for beta testing purposes, do not enroll in the beta program.
