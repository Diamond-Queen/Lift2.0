Subject: Important: Updates to Lift Terms — Refund & Password Reset Policies

Hi {{first_name || 'Lift user'}},

We're writing to let you know we've updated Lift's Terms of Service to clarify our Refund Policy and Password Reset Policy.

What changed:
- Refund Policy: Clarifies when refunds may be issued (billing errors, duplicate charges, or confirmed fraud) and the process to request a refund.
- Password Reset Policy: Adds details about one-time reset links, expiration (typically 1 hour), and that password resets only update credentials (subscriptions and data are preserved).

No action is required on your part. These updates are intended to improve transparency and help you understand how account recovery and billing issues are handled.

If you have questions or concerns, contact us at williams.lift101@gmail.com.

Thanks,
The Lift Team
